    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is Dagupan City, Philippines, the place I call home and the place I've
        always been since birth.</p>
    <p>It is known as the "Bangus Capital of the Philippines," renowned for producing what many
        consider the tastiest milkfish due to the unique brackish waters of its rivers and ponds.
        This pride is celebrated every April during the massive Bangus Festival, which features the
        "Kalutan ed Dalan," a record-breaking event where kilometers of grills are lined up along
        the main streets to cook thousands of fish at once.</p>
