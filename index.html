        <p>Hello! My name is Rinoa Radovan, and I'm from the Philippines. Something about me is that
            I’ve always been very art-inclined, and I spend much of my free time
            reading, journaling, sketching, and painting. I am currently studying Web Development
            and Design under the course path of Web and Computer Programming
            because of my strong interest in graphic design and my desire to
            expand my
            creative portfolio. While the technical aspects of this field are quite new to me, I am
            dedicated to
            persevering and mastering these skills, as I believe they will be essential for my
            professional
            growth. I'm really looking forward to this journey and am excited for what the future
            holds for me in this industry. </p>
