        <p>Hello! My name is Rinoa Radovan, and I'm from the Philippines. Something about me is that
            I’ve always been very art-inclined, and I spend much of my free time
            reading, journaling, sketching, and painting. I am currently studying Web Development
            and Design under the course path of Web and Computer Programming
            because of my strong interest in graphic design and my desire to
            expand my
            creative portfolio using the knowledge I will gain through this journey. While the
            technical aspects of this field are quite new to me, I am
            dedicated to
            persevering and mastering these skills, as I believe they will be essential for my
            professional
            growth. I'm really looking forward to this journey and am excited for what the future
            holds for me in this industry. </p>

        <p>Home to over 117 million people, the Philippines is a vast Southeast Asian archipelago
            consisting of more
            than 7,000 islands. From the world-famous white sand beaches of Boracay and the
            limestone
            cliffs of Palawan to the
            historic streets of Vigan and the bustling metropolis of Manila, the country offers a
            unique blend
            of Spanish, American, and indigenous influences. This rich cultural heritage is
            reflected in the
            diverse festivals, flavorful cuisine, and the legendary warmth and hospitality of the
            Filipino
            people.</p>
